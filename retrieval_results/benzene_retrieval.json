The most characteristic\nsystemic effect resulting from high enough intermediate and chronic benzene exposure is\narrested development of blood cells. Studies have linked overexposure to benzene to many\nhematological effects including aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, leukopenia, and\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. In vivo and in vitro data from both humans and animals show\nthat benzene and/or its metabolites are genotoxic. Studies in animals provide supporting\nevidence for the carcinogenicity of inhaled benzene. Epidemiological studies have reported\na causal relationship between occupational benzene exposures and acute myelogenous\nleukemia. Some studies suggest associations between benzene exposure and\nnon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and other cancers. Benzene has been\nclassified as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) by IARC, and the ECHA C&L Inventory\nstates it may cause cancer (Carc. 1B). IARC concluded that benzene causes acute myeloid\nleukemia and a positive association has been observed for acute lymphatic leukemia,\nchronic lymphatic leukemia, non-hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Human studies\nsuggest that female fertility and menstrual cycles were effected by benzene exposure;\nhowever, due to uncertainties in exposure and limited data the studies were considered\ninconclusive.",
