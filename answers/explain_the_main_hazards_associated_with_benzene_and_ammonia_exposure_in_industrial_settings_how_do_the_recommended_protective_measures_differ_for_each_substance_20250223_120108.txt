Query: Explain the main hazards associated with benzene and ammonia exposure in industrial settings. How do the recommended protective measures differ for each substance?

Answer:
I can explain the main hazards and protective measures for benzene, but I cannot provide information about ammonia as it is not mentioned in the provided documents.

Benzene Hazards:

*   **Flammability:** Benzene is a highly flammable liquid and vapor and an extremely flammable gas [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 1].
*   **Health Hazards:** Benzene is harmful if swallowed, causes skin and serious eye irritation, may cause genetic defects and cancer, causes damage to organs through prolonged or repeated exposure, and may be fatal if swallowed and enters airways [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 1]. Benzene exposure may occur through inhalation, ingestion, skin absorption or eye contact and can cause skin, eye, and respiratory irritation [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 7]. The most characteristic systemic effect resulting from high enough intermediate and chronic benzene exposure is arrested development of blood cells [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 7]. Studies have linked overexposure to benzene to many hematological effects including aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, leukopenia, and myelodysplastic syndrome [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 7].

Protective measures for Benzene:

*   **Engineering Controls:** Appropriate engineering controls include showers, eyewash stations, and ventilation systems [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 5].
*   **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**
    *   **Eye/face protection:** Tight sealing safety goggles [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 5].
    *   **Hand Protection:** Wear suitable impervious gloves [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 5].
    *   **Skin and body protection:** Wear suitable protective clothing, long sleeved clothing, chemical resistant apron and antistatic boots [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 5].
    *   **Respiratory protection:** When workers are facing concentrations above the exposure limit they must use appropriate certified respirators [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 5]. Use a NIOSH approved respirator when there is a potential for airborne concentrations to exceed occupational exposure limits [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 5]. A Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) should be used for fire fighting [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 5]. Use a NIOSH approved positive-pressure supplied air respirator if there is a potential for uncontrolled release, exposure levels are unknown, in oxygen deficient (less than 19.5% oxygen), or any other circumstance where an air-purifying respirator may not provide adequate protection [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 5].
*   **Hygiene:** Do not eat, drink or smoke when using this product [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 5]. Contaminated work clothing should not be allowed out of the workplace [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 5]. Regular cleaning of equipment, work area and clothing is recommended [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 5]. Wash hands before breaks and immediately after handling the product [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 5]. Avoid contact with skin, eyes or clothing [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 5].
*   **Handling precautions:** Obtain special instructions before use and do not handle until all safety precautions have been read and understood [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 2]. Keep away from heat/sparks/open flames/hot surfaces. - No smoking [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 2]. Keep container tightly closed [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 2]. Ground/or bond container and receiving equipment [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 2]. Use explosion-proof electrical/ ventilating / lighting / equipment [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 2]. Use only non-sparking tools [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 2]. Take precautionary measures against static discharge [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page 2].
