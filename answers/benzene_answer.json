  "answer": "Benzene exposure can cause skin, eye, and respiratory irritation. Chronic exposure can lead to arrested development of blood cells and has been linked to hematological effects including aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, leukopenia, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Benzene is classified as carcinogenic to humans and may cause cancer [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page: 7]. Protective measures include using personal protective equipment, avoiding contact with skin and eyes, avoiding breathing vapors or mists, and using grounding and bonding connections to prevent static discharge [Document: Benzene.pdf, Page: 9].\n\nAmmonia exposure can cause serious fire or explosion hazards [Document: Amonia-001003.pdf, Page: 4]. It is corrosive to the skin and causes serious eye damage [Document: Amonia-001003_v2.pdf, Page: 6]. It can also displace oxygen and cause rapid suffocation [Document: Amonia-001003.pdf, Page: 2]. Protective measures include wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, using only with adequate ventilation, and wearing an appropriate respirator when ventilation is inadequate [Document: Amonia-001003.pdf, Page: 4].
