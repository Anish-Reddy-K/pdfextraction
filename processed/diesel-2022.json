      "text": "Inhalation : Excessive exposure may cause irritations to the nose, throat, lungs and\nrespiratory tract. Central nervous system (brain) effects may include headache,\ndizziness, loss of balance and coordination, unconsciousness, coma, respiratory\nfailure.\nWARNING: the burning of any hydrocarbon as a fuel in an area without\nadequate ventilation may result in hazardous levels of combustion products,\nincluding carbon monoxide, and inadequate oxygen levels, which may cause\nunconsciousness, suffocation, and death.\nINGESTION : The major health threat of ingestion occurs from the danger of aspiration\n(breathing) of liquid drops into the lungs, particularly from vomiting. Aspiration\nmay result in chemical pneumonia (fluid in the lungs), severe lung damage,\nrespiratory failure and even death.\n- Chronic Effect: Similar products produced skin cancer and systemic toxicity in laboratory animals\nfollowing repeated applications. The significance of these results to human exposures has not been\ndetermined. IARC classifies whole diesel fuel exhaust particulates as probably carcinogenic to\nhumans (Group 2A). NIOSH regards whole diesel fuel exhaust particulates as a potential cause of\noccupational lung cancer based on animal studies and limited evidence in humans.\nSection 4: First Aid Measures\nEye contact : In case of contact with eyes, immediately flush with clean, low-pressure water for\nat least 15 min. Hold eyelids open to ensure adequate flushing. Seek medical\nattention.\nSkin contact : Remove contaminated clothing. Wash contaminated areas thoroughly with soap\nand water. Obtain medical attention if irritation or redness develops.\nInhalation : Remove person to fresh air. If person is not breathing provide artificial respiration.\nIf necessary, provide additional oxygen once breathing is restored if trained to do\nso. Seek medical attention immediately.\nIngestion : DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. Do not give liquids. Obtain immediate medical\nattention.\nSection 5: Firefighting Measures\nSuitable extinguishing media : Small fires: Any extinguisher suitable for Class B fires, dry\nchemical, CO2, water spray, fire fighting foam, or Halon. Large\nfires: Water spray, fog or fire fighting foam. Water may be\nineffective for fighting the fire, but may be used to cool fire-\nexposed containers.\nFire and explosion hazards : Vapors may be ignited rapidly when exposed to heat, spark,\nopen flame or other source of ignition. When mixed with air\nand exposed to an ignition source, flammable vapors can burn\nin the open or explode in confined spaces. Being heavier than\nair, vapors may travel long distances to an ignition source and\nflashback. Runoff to sewer may cause fire or explosion hazard.\nSection 6: Accidental Release Measures\nPersonal precautions, : Wear appropriate protective equipment. Eliminate ignitions\nprotective equipment, and sources and ventilate the area with explosion proof\nemergency procedures equipment. Wash thoroughly after handling.\nIssue date: Jan,2022 Issue : 2\nSafety and Environment Dep/J.B Page 2",
