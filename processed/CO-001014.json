Use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation or\ncontrols other engineering controls to keep worker exposure to airborne contaminants below any\nrecommended or statutory limits. The engineering controls also need to keep gas,\nvapor or dust concentrations below any lower explosive limits. Use explosion-proof\nventilation equipment.\nEnvironmental exposure : Emissions from ventilation or work process equipment should be checked to ensure\ncontrols they comply with the requirements of environmental protection legislation. In some\ncases, fume scrubbers, filters or engineering modifications to the process equipment\nwill be necessary to reduce emissions to acceptable levels.\nIndividual protection measures\nHygiene measures : Wash hands, forearms and face thoroughly after handling chemical products, before\neating, smoking and using the lavatory and at the end of the working period.\nAppropriate techniques should be used to remove potentially contaminated clothing.\nWash contaminated clothing before reusing. Ensure that eyewash stations and safety\nshowers are close to the workstation location.\nEye/face protection : Safety eyewear complying with an approved standard should be used when a risk\nassessment indicates this is necessary to avoid exposure to liquid splashes, mists,\ngases or dusts. If contact is possible, the following protection should be worn, unless\nthe assessment indicates a higher degree of protection: safety glasses with side-\nshields.\nSkin protection\nHand protection : Chemical-resistant, impervious gloves complying with an approved standard should be\nworn at all times when handling chemical products if a risk assessment indicates this is\nnecessary. Considering the parameters specified by the glove manufacturer, check\nduring use that the gloves are still retaining their protective properties. It should be\nnoted that the time to breakthrough for any glove material may be different for different\nglove manufacturers. In the case of mixtures, consisting of several substances, the\nprotection time of the gloves cannot be accurately estimated.\nBody protection : Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being\nperformed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before\nhandling this product. When there is a risk of ignition from static electricity, wear anti-\nstatic protective clothing. For the greatest protection from static discharges, clothing\nshould include anti-static overalls, boots and gloves.\nOther skin protection : Appropriate footwear and any additional skin protection measures should be selected\nbased on the task being performed and the risks involved and should be approved by a\nspecialist before handling this product.\nRespiratory protection : Based on the hazard and potential for exposure, select a respirator that meets the\nappropriate standard or certification. Respirators must be used according to a\nrespiratory protection program to ensure proper fitting, training, and other important\naspects of use. Respirator selection must be based on known or anticipated exposure\nlevels, the hazards of the product and the safe working limits of the selected respirator.\nDate of issue/Date of revision :11/5/2020 Date of previous issue :7/29/2020 Version :1.02 5/12",
