In case\nof inadequate ventilation wear respiratory protection. Keep away from clothing and\nother combustible materials. Keep reduction valves, valves and fittings free from oil and\ngrease. Use only outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. Avoid release to the\nenvironment. Do not breathe gas.\nResponse : Collect spillage. In case of fire: Stop leak if safe to do so. IF INHALED: Remove\nperson to fresh air and keep comfortable for breathing. Immediately call a POISON\nCENTER or doctor. IF SWALLOWED: Rinse mouth. Do NOT induce vomiting. IF ON\nSKIN (or hair): Take off immediately all contaminated clothing. Rinse skin with water. IF\nIN EYES: Rinse cautiously with water for several minutes. Remove contact lenses, if\npresent and easy to do. Continue rinsing.\nStorage : Store locked up. Protect from sunlight. Store in a well-ventilated place.\nDisposal : Dispose of contents and container in accordance with all local, regional, national and\ninternational regulations.\nHazards not otherwise : None known.\nclassified\nSection 3.

First aid measures\nDescription of necessary first aid measures\nEye contact : Get medical attention immediately. Call a poison center or physician. Immediately flush\neyes with plenty of water, occasionally lifting the upper and lower eyelids. Check for and\nremove any contact lenses. Continue to rinse for at least 10 minutes. Chemical burns\nmust be treated promptly by a physician.\nInhalation : Get medical attention immediately. Call a poison center or physician. Remove victim to\nfresh air and keep at rest in a position comfortable for breathing. If it is suspected that\nfumes are still present, the rescuer should wear an appropriate mask or self-contained\nbreathing apparatus. If not breathing, if breathing is irregular or if respiratory arrest\noccurs, provide artificial respiration or oxygen by trained personnel. It may be\ndangerous to the person providing aid to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. If\nunconscious, place in recovery position and get medical attention immediately. Maintain\nan open airway. Loosen tight clothing such as a collar, tie, belt or waistband.\nSkin contact : Get medical attention immediately. Call a poison center or physician. Flush\ncontaminated skin with plenty of water. Remove contaminated clothing and shoes.\nWash contaminated clothing thoroughly with water before removing it, or wear gloves.\nContinue to rinse for at least 10 minutes. Chemical burns must be treated promptly by a\nphysician. Wash clothing before reuse.

In some\ncases, fume scrubbers, filters or engineering modifications to the process equipment\nwill be necessary to reduce emissions to acceptable levels.\nIndividual protection measures\nHygiene measures : Wash hands, forearms and face thoroughly after handling chemical products, before\neating, smoking and using the lavatory and at the end of the working period.\nAppropriate techniques should be used to remove potentially contaminated clothing.\nWash contaminated clothing before reusing. Ensure that eyewash stations and safety\nshowers are close to the workstation location.\nEye/face protection : Safety eyewear complying with an approved standard should be used when a risk\nassessment indicates this is necessary to avoid exposure to liquid splashes, mists,\ngases or dusts. If contact is possible, the following protection should be worn, unless\nthe assessment indicates a higher degree of protection: chemical splash goggles and/\nor face shield.
