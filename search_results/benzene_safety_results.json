Impervious gloves.\nSkin and body protection Wear suitable protective clothing. Long sleeved clothing. Chemical resistant apron.\nAntistatic boots.\nRespiratory protection When workers are facing concentrations above the exposure limit they must use\nappropriate certified respirators. Use a NIOSH approved respirator when there is a potential\nfor airborne concentrations to exceed occupational exposure limits. Refer to OSHA 29 CFR\n1910.134, ANSI Z88.2, NIOSH Respirator Decision Logic, and the respirator manufacturer\nfor additional guidance on respiratory protection selection. A Self-Contained Breathing\nApparatus (SCBA) should be used for fire fighting. Use a NIOSH approved\npositive-pressure supplied air respirator if there is a potential for uncontrolled release,\nexposure levels are unknown, in oxygen deficient (less than 19.5% oxygen), or any other\ncircumstance where an air-purifying respirator may not provide adequate protection.\nGeneral hygiene considerations Do not eat, drink or smoke when using this product. Contaminated work clothing should not\nbe allowed out of the workplace. Regular cleaning of equipment, work area and clothing is\nrecommended. Wash hands before breaks and immediately after handling the product.\nWear suitable gloves and eye/face protection. Avoid contact with skin, eyes or clothing.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n888100004765 Benzene Page 5 / 11",

The most characteristic\nsystemic effect resulting from high enough intermediate and chronic benzene exposure is\narrested development of blood cells. Studies have linked overexposure to benzene to many\nhematological effects including aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, leukopenia, and\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. In vivo and in vitro data from both humans and animals show\nthat benzene and/or its metabolites are genotoxic. Studies in animals provide supporting\nevidence for the carcinogenicity of inhaled benzene. Epidemiological studies have reported\na causal relationship between occupational benzene exposures and acute myelogenous\nleukemia. Some studies suggest associations between benzene exposure and\nnon-Hodgkinâ€™s lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and other cancers. Benzene has been\nclassified as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) by IARC, and the ECHA C&L Inventory\nstates it may cause cancer (Carc. 1B). IARC concluded that benzene causes acute myeloid\nleukemia and a positive association has been observed for acute lymphatic leukemia,\nchronic lymphatic leukemia, non-hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Human studies\nsuggest that female fertility and menstrual cycles were effected by benzene exposure;\nhowever, due to uncertainties in exposure and limited data the studies were considered\ninconclusive. Developmental effects have been observed in animals including persistent\nhematopoietic anomalies. It has been suggested that the reported benzene fetotoxicity of\ndecreased weight and skeletal variants is a function of maternal toxicity.\nHealth hazard and classification information\nSkin Corrosion/Irritation Category Classification based on data available for ingredients.
