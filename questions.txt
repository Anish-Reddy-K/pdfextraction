1. Complex Multi-Part Question
Q: Explain the main hazards associated with benzene and ammonia exposure in industrial settings. How do the recommended protective measures differ for each substance?
(Requires AI to extract details from both the Benzene and Ammonia SDS documents and compare them.)

2. Data-Based Question
Q: What is the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for ammonia as per OSHA standards? How does it compare with the exposure limit for benzene?
(AI must extract numerical values from both documents and compare them.)

3. Cross-Document Analysis
Q: What are the key differences in handling and storage requirements for asphalt MC-70 and benzene?
(Requires AI to analyze storage guidelines in both SDS documents and highlight differences.)

4. Scenario-Based Question
Q: If a worker at an oil refinery is exposed to high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide, what first aid measures should be taken immediately?
(AI must refer to the oil refinery safety document and possibly the asphalt SDS, as hydrogen sulfide is mentioned in those.)

5. Regulatory & Compliance Question
Q: According to OSHA Hazard Communication Standards (29 CFR 1910.1200), which of the provided substances are classified as hazardous? List their hazard categories.
(Tests AI's ability to identify regulatory classifications across multiple documents.)

6. Process-Oriented Question
Q: Explain the process of refining crude oil into its various products. What role does benzene play in petrochemical production?
(AI must retrieve information from the oil refineries document and benzene SDS.) 
Q: Compare the fire hazards of asphalt MC-70, benzene, and ammonia. Which is the most flammable, and what firefighting measures are recommended for each?
(Tests AI's ability to assess risk across multiple sources and compare firefighting recommendations.)

8. Incident Response Question
Q: If an accidental ammonia leak occurs, what steps should an emergency responder take to ensure safety and minimize environmental impact?
(AI must extract emergency response steps from the ammonia SDS.)

9. Material Composition Question
Q: What are the main chemical components of Asphalt MC-70? How does its composition contribute to its potential hazards?
(Requires AI to locate composition details and infer hazard relationships.)

10. Workplace Safety Question
Q: In an oil refinery, what are the main safety precautions workers should follow when performing maintenance in confined spaces?
(AI must retrieve information on refinery safety from the oil refineries document.)

11. Latest Information Extraction
Q: What is the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for ammonia as per California regulations?
(This tests whether the AI can retrieve the most up-to-date data from the latest ammonia document.)
